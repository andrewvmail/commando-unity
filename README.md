Commando Unity
===================


Commando Unity is a clone of Commando that originally came out for the Commodore64. This game was written in Unity, using C#. The sprites were provided by a third party as this was a school project. One of its neat features is a custom font writer (text on screen is drawn with the Commando font, any text you want could be drawn through code).
