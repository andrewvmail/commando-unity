Commando Unity
===================


Commando Unity is a clone of Commando that originally came out for the Commodore64. This game was written in Unity, using C#. The sprites were provided by a third party as this was a school project. It features a custom fontwriter (text on screen is drawn with the Commando font, any text could be drawn through code).
